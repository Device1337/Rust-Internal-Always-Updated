# Rust-Internal-Always-Updated
This is a private source Rust source, it does not need any updating besides placing the visual asset. If you are not familiar with rust, you will not understand. This uses ill2cpp dumper to auto update offsets. This is fully undetected and using my own framework, not ImGui. This is my source, and nothing is pasted. Feel free to check.
